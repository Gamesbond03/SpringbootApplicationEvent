# SpringbootApplicationEvent
This project triggers a CacheRefresh Event which is captured in CaptureCacheRefreshCompleteEvent.java(works as expected).  This project also includes a junit test which triggers a cache refresh event and expects a cache refresh complete event in response which is not captured by junit test case.
